## Quick Overview

```sh

cd my-app
npm start
```

### Get Started Immediately

## Creating an App

### npx

### npm

_`npm init <initializer>` is available in npm 6+_

### Yarn

```sh
yarn how-about my-app
```

_`yarn create` is available in Yarn 0.25+_

It will create a directory called `my-app` inside the current folder.<br>
Inside that directory, it will generate the initial project structure and install the transitive dependencies:

```
my-app
├── README.md
├── node_modules
├── package.json
├── .gitignore
└── src
```

No configuration or complicated folder structures, just the files you need to build your app.<br>
Once the installation is done, you can open your project folder:

```sh
cd my-app
```

Inside the newly created project, you can run some built-in commands:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`


### `npm test` or `yarn test`


### `npm run build` or `yarn build`
